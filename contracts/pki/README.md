The EOS blockchain is well suited to host a robust public key infastructure (PKI) capable of automating information security at the peer-to-peer level.

The `contract/pki` is designed to provide an infastructure to host the public encryption and signing keys for any account on the EOS network to enable all EOS applications to provide peer-to-peer encryption services.

This is a work in progress and your feedback is welcome!
